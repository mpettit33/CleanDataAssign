# Cleaning of Accelerometer Data, Assignment for Cleaning Data Course

The script within 'run_analysis' takes both test and training accelerometer data for 30 subjects and 6 activities and creates one tidy data 
text file 'Summary.txt' which calculates the mean of all of the mean and standard deviation measurements for each subject for each of 
their activities.  

There is also a code book pdf which describes the columns of the text file and what each measurement is.
